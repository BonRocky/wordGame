# wordGame
My first python mini-project...
In this small project, I've implemented a word game. I would like to clarify that the game is only available in Russian, but maybe later I will fix it. 


# INSTRUCTION:
To start the game, simply run the file. Then you will have 5 attempts to guess the word. Enter only a five-character word into the console! If you guessed the letter and correctly indicated its position in the word, then this will be displayed to you in the console. A message will also be displayed in the console if you guessed the letter, but did not guess its position. Good luck! 🍀
